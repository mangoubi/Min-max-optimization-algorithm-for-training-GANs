--The file "MNIST_Code.ipynb" contains the code used for the simulations in Figure 2, and in Appendix E.1, E.3, E.4, and E.5 of our paper.  (This file contains the code for our algorithm and for GDA, on the MNIST dataset.)

--The file "CIFAR_Code.ipynb" contains the code used for the simulations in Figure 1 and in Appendix E.2 of our paper.  (This file contains the code for our algorithm and for GDA, on the CIFAR-10 dataset.)

--The file "Gaussian_Mixture_code.ipynb" contains the code for the simulations in Figure 3 and Appendix E.6 of our paper.  (This file contains the code for our algorithm, GDA, and Unrolled GANs, on the four Gaussian mixture dataset.)

--The file "MNIST_decreasing_temperature_Code.ipynb" contains the code that was used to generate the results in Appendix E.5 of our paper. (This file contains the code for the version of our algorithm with randomized accept/reject step and decreasing temperature schedule.)
